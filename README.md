# BellaBeasts_CaseStudy_using_R_Programming
The main goal of this project is to analyze the smart device usage data in order to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. These insights will then be applied to Bellabeat products which will help generate possible recommendations for the companyâ€™s future marketing strategies.
